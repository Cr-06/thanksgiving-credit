    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A grilled cheese sandwich is a classic comfort food made by grilling slices of bread with melted cheese in between. 
        The bread is typically buttered on the outside to create a crispy, golden-brown crust, while the cheese inside melts 
        to a gooey, delicious filling. It's a simple yet satisfying meal that can be enjoyed any time of the day.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread (white, whole wheat, or your choice)</li>
        <li>2-3 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, Swiss, or your choice)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of butter (softened)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat a skillet or griddle over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Butter one side of each slice of bread.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, onto the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the cheese slices on top of the bread in the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with the second slice of bread, buttered side up.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until the bottom slice is golden brown, about 3-4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully flip the sandwich and cook the other side until golden brown and the cheese is melted, another 
            3-4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from skillet, let cool for a minute, then slice and serve.
