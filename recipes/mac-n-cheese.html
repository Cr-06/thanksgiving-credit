    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Macaroni and cheese, often abbreviated as mac and cheese, is a classic comfort food dish made with cooked macaroni pasta 
        and a creamy cheese sauce. The dish is typically baked in the oven to create a golden, crispy top layer, while the inside 
        remains rich and cheesy. Mac and cheese is loved for its simplicity, versatility, and indulgent flavor, making it a favorite 
        among both kids and adults alike.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Cook the macaroni according to the package instructions until al dente. 
            Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for about 
            1-2 minutes until it forms a roux (a thick paste).
        </li>
        <li>
            Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Continue to cook and stir until the sauce thickens, 
            about 5-7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt 
            and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the mac and cheese mixture into a greased baking dish. If desired, sprinkle breadcrumbs evenly over the top 
            for a crunchy topping.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade mac and 
            cheese!
